About the field :-
----------------
whenever I enter into my room ,my roommates are watching youtube-shots or watching instagram reels and whole day laying on the bed

Problem Now adays :-
-----------------
After the introduction of reels or shots childrens/peoples are more addicted with mobile more than before.
These algorithims are set in such a way that if you watch one video,unknowingly you are going to waste 2 or 3 hour without knowing,
because these apps will show you based on the reaction over the video.You would be watching the videos deeply with different emmotions,
that's the reason why everyone are facing lazyness ,showing lack of intrest or feeling tired while dealing with other task they have. 
 
Your Solutions:-
--------------
Create an softwire that will manage the uses of other apps.In that softwire you will select which app or which website you are restricted
to use long time and it will ask to set the maximum time you want to use in.It will give 20 minute time to reset the time , if the time is
more than 20 minute it will ask what you have done today .AI will verify your response or at nignt (at a perticular that you would have saved)
you can respond to your work done list and then you can make changes to the settings.
